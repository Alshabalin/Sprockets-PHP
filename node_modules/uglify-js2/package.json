More advanced\nAPI documentation will be made available later.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n    uglifyjs2 [input files] [options]\n\nUglifyJS2 can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the\ninput files first, then pass the options.  UglifyJS will parse input files\nin sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the\nsame global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some\nvariable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.\n\nIf you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input\nfiles.\n\nThe available options are:\n\n    --source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map.\n                                                                          [string]\n    --source-map-root  The path to the original source to be included in the\n                       source map.                                        [string]\n    --in-source-map    Input source map, useful if you're compressing JS that was\n                       generated from some other original code.\n    -p, --prefix       Skip prefix for original filenames that appear in source\n                       maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3 directories from file\n                       names and ensure they are relative paths.\n    -o, --output       Output file (default STDOUT).\n    -b, --beautify     Beautify output/specify output options.            [string]\n    -m, --mangle       Mangle names/pass mangler options.                 [string]\n    -r, --reserved     Reserved names to exclude from mangling.\n    -c, --compress     Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass options\n                       like -c hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with no\n                       argument to use the default compression options.   [string]\n    -d, --define       Global definitions                                 [string]\n    --comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. By default this\n                       works like Google Closure, keeping JSDoc-style comments\n                       that contain \"@license\" or \"@preserve\". You can optionally\n                       pass one of the following arguments to this flag:\n                       - \"all\" to keep all comments\n                       - a valid JS regexp (needs to start with a slash) to keep\n                       only comments that match.\n                       Note that currently not *all* comments can be kept when\n                       compression is on, because of dead code removal or\n                       cascading statements into sequences.               [string]\n    --stats            Display operations run time on STDERR.            [boolean]\n    --acorn            Use Acorn for parsing.                            [boolean]\n    --spidermonkey     Assume input fles are SpiderMonkey AST format (as JSON).\n                                                                         [boolean]\n    -v, --verbose      Verbose                                           [boolean]\n\nSpecify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output\ngoes to STDOUT.\n\n## Source map options\n\nUglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for\ndebugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass\n`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the\nsource map dumped).\n\nAdditionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the\noriginal files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input\nfiles to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of\ndirectories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source\nmap.\n\nFor example:\n\n    uglifyjs2 /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \\\n              /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \\\n              -o foo.min.js \\\n              --source-map foo.min.js.map \\\n              --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \\\n              -p 5 -c -m\n\nThe above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the\noutput in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source\nmapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and\n`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`\nas the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and\n`js/file2.js`).\n\n### Composed source map\n\nWhen you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as\nCoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd\nlike to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  UglifyJS has an\noption to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from\nCoffeeScript → compiled JS, UglifyJS can generate a map from CoffeeScript →\ncompressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original\nlocation.\n\nTo use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map\n/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point\nto the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit\ninput files from the command line.\n\n## Mangler options\n\nTo enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  Optionally you\ncan pass `-m sort` (we'll possibly have other flags in the future) in order\nto assign shorter names to most frequently used variables.  This saves a few\nhundred bytes on jQuery before gzip, but the output is _bigger_ after gzip\n(and seems to happen for other libraries I tried it on) therefore it's not\nenabled by default.\n\nWhen mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being\nmangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a\ncomma-separated list of names.  For example:\n\n    uglifyjs2 ... -m -r '$,require,exports'\n\nto prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.\n\n## Compressor options\n\nYou need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally\nyou can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form\n`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want\nto set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).\n\nThe defaults should be tuned for maximum compression on most code.  Here are\nthe available options (all are `true` by default, except `hoist_vars`):\n\n- `sequences` -- join consecutive simple statements using the comma operator\n- `properties` -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for\n  example `foo[\"bar\"] → foo.bar`\n- `dead-code` -- remove unreachable code\n- `drop-debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements\n- `unsafe` -- apply \"unsafe\" transformations (discussion below)\n- `conditionals` -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional\n  expressions\n- `comparisons` -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes, for example:\n  `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe`), attempts to negate binary nodes,\n  e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.\n- `evaluate` -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions\n- `booleans` -- various optimizations for boolean context, for example `!!a\n  ? b : c → a ? b : c`\n- `loops` -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops when we can\n  statically determine the condition\n- `unused` -- drop unreferenced functions and variables\n- `hoist-funs` -- hoist function declarations\n- `hoist-vars` -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false` by default\n  because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)\n- `if-return` -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue\n- `join-vars` -- join consecutive `var` statements\n- `cascade` -- small optimization for sequences, transform `x, x` into `x`\n  and `x = something(), x` into `x = something()`\n- `warnings` -- display warnings when dropping unreachable code or unused\n  declarations etc.\n\n### Conditional compilation\n\nYou can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global\nvariables that UglifyJS will assume to be constants (unless defined in\nscope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with\ndead code removal UglifyJS will discard the following from the output:\n\n    if (DEBUG) {\n        console.log(\"debug stuff\");\n    }\n\nUglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping\nunreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific\nwarning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.\n\nAnother way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a\nseparate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a\n`build/defines.js` file with the following:\n\n    const DEBUG = false;\n    const PRODUCTION = true;\n    // etc.\n\nand build your code like this:\n\n    uglifyjs2 build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c\n\nUglifyJS will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it\nwill evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable\ncode as usual.  The possible downside of this approach is that the build\nwill contain the `const` declarations.\n\n## Beautifier options\n\nThe code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In\ncase you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you\ncan pass additional arguments that control the code output:\n\n- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.\n  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even\n  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional\n  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.\n- `indent-level` (default 4)\n- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces\n- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal\n  objects\n- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs\n- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and\n  regexps\n- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of\n  `</script` in strings\n- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this\n  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to\n  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).\n  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated\n  by UglifyJS more readable.\n- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)\n- `ie-proof` (default `true`) -- generate “IE-proof” code (for now this\n  means add brackets around the do/while in code like this: `if (foo) do\n  something(); while (bar); else ...`.\n- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,\n  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single\n  statement.\n\n### Keeping copyright notices or other comments\n\nYou can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By\ndefault it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain \"@preserve\" or\n\"@license\".  You can pass `--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a\nvalid JavaScript regexp to keep only comments that match this regexp.  For\nexample `--comments '/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain \"foo\"\nor \"bar\".\n\nNote, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For\nexample:\n\n    function f() {\n      /** @preserve Foo Bar */\n      function g() {\n        // this function is never called\n      }\n      return something();\n    }\n\nEven though it has \"@preserve\", the comment will be lost because the inner\nfunction `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is\ndiscarded by the compressor as not referenced.\n\nThe safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that\nneeds to me kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.\n\n## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST\n\nUglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for\n[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)\nwe can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,\nUglifyJS now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.\n\nFor example [Acorn](https://github.com/marijnh/acorn) is a super-fast parser\nthat produces a SpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses\none file and dumps the AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use UglifyJS\nto mangle and compress that:\n\n    acorn file.js | uglifyjs2 --spidermonkey -m -c\n\nThe `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not\nJavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we\ndon't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our\ninternal AST.\n\n### Use Acorn for parsing\n\nMore for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all\nthe parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require(\"acorn\")`.  At\nthe time I'm writing this it needs\n[this commit](https://github.com/mishoo/acorn/commit/17c0d189c7f9ce5447293569036949b5d0a05fef)\nin Acorn to support multiple input files and properly generate source maps.\n\nAcorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but\nconverting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so\nin total it's a bit more than just using UglifyJS's own parser.\n",
